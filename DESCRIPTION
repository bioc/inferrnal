Description: Search for matches to a covariance model in RNA sequences, or
    align RNA sequences to a covariance model. Covariance models use a
    combination of primary structure (nucleotide sequence) and secondary
    structure (base pairing) to model non-protein-coding RNA families.
    This package is a thin wrapper around the Infernal package, which is not
    included and needs to be installed independently.
